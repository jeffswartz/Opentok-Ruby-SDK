module OpenTok
  # Represents a broadcast of an OpenTok session.
  # @attr [string] id
  #   The broadcast ID.
  #
  # @attr [string] session_id
  #   The session ID of the OpenTok session associated with this archive.
  #
  # @attr [string] project_id
  #   The API key associated with the broadcast.
  #
  # @attr [int] created_at
  #   The time at which the broadcast was created, in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
  #
  # @attr [int] updated_at
  #   For this start method, this timestamp matches the createdAt timestamp.
  #
  # @attr [string] resolution
  #   The resolution of the broadcast: either "640x480" (SD, the default) or "1280x720" (HD). This property is optional.
  #
  # @attr [Hash] broadcastUrls is defined as follows:
  #   This object defines the types of broadcast streams you want to start (both HLS and RTMP).
  #   You can include HLS, RTMP, or both as broadcast streams. If you include RTMP streaming,
  #   you can specify up to five target RTMP streams (or just one).
  #   The (<code>:hls</code>)  property is set  to an empty [Hash] object. The HLS URL is returned in the response.
  #   The (<code>:rtmp</code>)  property is set  to an [Array] of Rtmp [Hash] properties.
  #   For each RTMP , specify (<code>:serverUrl</code>) for the RTMP server URL,
  #   (<code>:streamName</code>) such as the YouTube Live stream name or the Facebook stream key),
  #   and (optionally) (<code>:id</code>), a unique ID for the stream.
  #
  # @attr [string] status The status of the RTMP stream.
  #     * "connecting" --  The OpenTok platform is in the process of connecting to the remote RTMP server.
  #                        This is the initial state, and it is the status if you start when there are no streams published in the session.
  #                        It changes to "live" when there are streams (or it changes to one of the other states).
  #     * "live --         The OpenTok platform has successfully connected to the remote RTMP server, and the media is streaming.
  #     * "offline" --     The OpenTok platform could not connect to the remote RTMP server. This is due to an unreachable server or an error in the RTMP handshake. Causes include rejected RTMP connections, non-existing RTMP applications, rejected stream names, authentication errors, etc. Check that the server is online, and that you have provided the correct server URL and stream name.
  #     * "error" --       There is an error in the OpenTok platform.
